# Actions for Nautilus Config Editor

This repository is an editor for [Actions for nautilus](https://github.com/bassmanitram/actions-for-nautilus) configuration files. I created it because the UI of the editor included with the tool made it difficult to use with highly nested actions

## Planed features

- [ ] Helper text for every field based on the [Actions for nautilus](https://github.com/bassmanitram/actions-for-nautilus) documentation

## Develop

Clone this repository to a new folder in your local machine, then enter into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/SrJuggernaut/actions-for-nautilus-config-editor.git
cd actions-for-nautilus-config-editor
```

This project uses bun for dependency management, so you will need to install it. When you are done, run:

```
bun install
```
Then you can run the development server with:

```
bun run develop
```
